ðŸ“‚ James D. Rodgers â€“ Portfolio Repository

This repository showcases a selection of my technical projects across Python, applied AI, and SQL/database systems. Each project demonstrates my ability to design structured, maintainable code, apply data-driven problem-solving, and communicate solutions clearly.

ðŸ”‘ Featured Projects
1. Bank Account Management (CS 131B â€“ Project 11)

Skills: Python, OOP, Encapsulation, Inheritance, Method Overriding.

Highlights:

Defined Account, SavingsAccount, and CheckingAccount classes.

Implemented deposits, withdrawals, interest calculation, and transaction fees.

Demonstrates practical use of object-oriented programming principles and testing through a sample run.

2. CBT Journal â€“ Gradio App

Skills: Python, OpenAI API, Data Modeling, Modular Architecture, Gradio UI.

Highlights:

Integrated AI with structured prompts and guardrails for safe, non-clinical reflections.

Designed modular components (dataclasses, JSONL/CSV storage, AI utilities, Gradio interface).

Built features like an emotion wheel, cognitive distortion library, and exportable journal history.

Demonstrates ability to combine machine learning APIs, data pipelines, and front-end usability.

3. ChurchDATA SQL Case Study
